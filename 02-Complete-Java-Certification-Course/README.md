## What is a computer program?
```
A computer program is simply a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. 

You can't tell it what to do in English or some other spoken language. You need to use a programming language to provide the instructions. 

Computers are capable of understanding programming languages and one of the most popular programming languages in the world is known as Java.
